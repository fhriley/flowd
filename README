This is flowd, a NetFlow collector daemon.

It is intended to be small, fast and secure.

It features some basic filtering to limit or tag the flows that are recorded
and is privilege separated, to limit security exposure to any mistakes I may 
have made.

flowd stores records on disk in a compact binary format, see XXX.h for a 
specification in the form of a C header file or XXX.pl for an example
reader application. It supports NetFlow v.1 and NetFlow v.5 packet formats 
and both IPv4 and IPv6 transports.

Large parts of this code have been shamelessly taken from OpenBSD, 
in particular bgpd (the configuration parser) and OpenSSH (the privsep fd
passing). All of this code is under a BSD-like license, but read the LICENSE
file for details.
