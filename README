This is flowd, a NetFlow collector daemon.

It is intended to be small, fast and secure.

It features some basic filtering to limit or tag the flows that are recorded
and is privilege separated, to limit security exposure from bugs in flowd 
itself.

flowd stores records on disk in a compact binary format, see store.h for a 
specification in the form of a C header file. Flowd.pm is a PERL module that
understands this format too. See the flowd-reader and reader.pl applications
for examples of the C and PERL APIs respectively.

This on-disk format is a parametised format capable of storing a superset of 
NetFlow v.5. Exactly which components of the NetFlow records actually get 
written to disk may be specified at runtime, so the logs can be made quite 
compact by excluding information that is uninteresting to you. An optional,
per-record CRC32 checksum is provided to detect log corruption.

At present, flowd supports NetFlow v.1 and NetFlow v.5 packet formats over both 
IPv4 and IPv6 transports. This will be extended to include an IPv6 flowd export
format, either using sflow, the IPFIX standard or an extension to NetFlow v.5 
in the near future.

Large parts of this code have been shamelessly taken from OpenBSD, in 
particular bgpd (the configuration parser) and OpenSSH (the privsep fd passing 
and CRC23 code). All of this code is under BSD-like licenses, but read the 
LICENSE file for details.
