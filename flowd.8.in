.Sh NAME
.Nm flowd
.Nd NetFlow collector daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm flowd
.Op Fl hd
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a small NetFlow collector daemon capable of understanding Cisco NetFlow 
version 1 and version 5 packet formats.
.Nm
supports filtering and tagging of received flows before they are stored on 
disk, using a filter syntax similar to the OpenBSD PF packet filter.
The on-disk format is flexible in that it allows selection of which packet
fields are recorded, so logs may be made very compact.
.Pp
.Nm
is configured using the
.Xr flowd.conf 5
file, which typically resides in
.Pa @CONFPATH@/flowd.conf
.Nm
may be terminated by sending it a 
.Dv SIGTERM
signal.
Upon receipt of a
.Dv SIGHUP
.Nm
will close and reopen its logfile.
.Pp
The command-line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Places
.Nm
in debugging mode.
In this mode,
.Nm
will not fork to the background and will print verbose diagnostics, including
details of each flow received.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Specify an alternate location for the configuration file
Default is 
.Pa @CONFPATH@/flowd.conf
.It Fl h
Displays commandline usage information.
