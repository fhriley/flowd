These are the platforms that flowd is tested on, along with any relevant notes.

Platform		Status		Testing		Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Debian testing		OK		some		[1]
Fedora Core 2		OK		well-tested	[1]
OpenBSD 3.5+		OK		well-tested
Redhat 9		OK		some		[1] [2]
Solaris 9		OK		little		[1]

Notes:
------

[1] Most operating systems don't set up /var/empty/dev/log to capture log
messages from chrooted processes like OpenBSD does. For Redhat-derived
distributions, you can modify the syslog options line in /etc/sysconfig/syslog
to add a listener. E.g.:

SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-m 0 -a /var/empty/dev/log"

[2] The socket module in Python-2.2 seems to lack the inet_pton() function 
that flowd.py uses for address translations. Right now, we only support 
Python 2.3
