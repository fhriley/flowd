These are the platforms that flowd is tested on, along with any relevant notes.

OpenBSD 3.5+		works fine

Fedora Core 2		works fine, see note [1] below

Redhat 9		works fine, except for Python API, see notes [1] & [2]

Debian testing		works fine for occasional tests, see note [1]

Notes:

[1] Most Linux distributions don't set up /var/empty/dev/log to capture log
messages from chrooted processes like OpenBSD does. For Redhat-derived
distributions, you can modify the syslog options line in /etc/sysconfig/syslog
to add a listener. E.g.:

SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-m 0 -a /var/empty/dev/log"

[2] The socket module in Python-2.2 seems to lack the inet_pton() function 
that flowd.py uses for address translations. Right now, we only support 
Python 2.3
