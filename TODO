* indicates things to do before 1.0 release

- Inetd mode (listen on stdin)
 - Exit value should indicate whether packet(s) were successfully parsed
 - Very useful for regress tests
 - or, listen on /unix/domain/path
   - would need to to send netflow packets
     - Capture from pcap
     - Send from log (see below)
   
- Regress tests							*
 - Config
 - Packet parsing
 - Flow storage
 - Output
 - Filtering

- Improve Filters 
 - Port predicates, e.g. "port 1024-65536", "port > 1024"
 - packets, octets (need predicates)
 - other fields, in particular netflow version
 - time of day filtering on flow_start|flow_finish
 - clarify what happens when fields are missing

- Improve log handling
 - E.g. multiple log files, based on tag?
 - support relaying of pre/post-filter packets to another agent
   - UDP
   - Unix domain socket (more important)
 - Vanilla text logging

- Improve Perl and Python documentation				*
- Add Perl and Python regress tests				*
- Add writing of binary flows to perl module			*

- Option to check TTL of inbound flow export packets
- Option to bind by interface name 
- IPv4 Multicast group join by interface. e.g. 
	join group 224.22.33.44 on fxp0

- Tools collection:
  - "flow-send", a small program to take on-disk flows and send them as 
    NetFlow packets to a chosen host
  - (or, patch flow-tools)

- More protocols: sflow, IPFIX

- Add calculation and storage of "normalised" flow timers, correcting for 
  flow probe clock errors by using difference between header->time_sec and 
  localtime (assumes flow collector clock is accurate!)

- Track sequence per peer and alert on flow drops

- Define net store.h types for:
  - min/max_pkt_lngth

- Discard protocol-specific state when we receive a packet in a different
  protocol

- Don't record any nf9 flows unless the entire packet is valid (right now,
  we only validate to the flowset level)
  - Could at least iterate over packet and check for truncation?

- Renovate Perl API.
 - This was my first attempt at writing C/Perl glue, so the interface is
   pretty clumsy :(

- Add support for legacy store logs to perl/python APIs

- XXX python API: add AF and raw address data for all addresses
- XXX set FLOWD_T_blah defines in store.h from autoconf
