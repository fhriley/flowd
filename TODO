- runtime reconfigure
  - parse config in monitor, deep-copy to child
  - Need to be careful about listener fds, merge changes or close+reopen??
  - We probably leak memory in parse.y right now

- Per-peer statistics, esp. errors
  - Does this make sense?

- Port predicates, e.g. "port 1024-65536"

- Improve log handling
 - E.g. multiple log files, based on tag?
 - support relaying of pre/post-filter packets to another agent (via UDP)

- Instead of reading/writing flow logs, store.c functions should format them
 to memory buffers (e.g. so they can be sent over the network)
