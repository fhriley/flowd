- support relaying of pre/post-filter packets to another agent (via UDP)

- runtime reconfigure
  - parse config in monitor, deep-copy to child
  - Need to be careful about listener fds, merge changes or close+reopen??

- don't pass sockaddr_storage pointers around, just use (struct sockaddr *)

- Per-peer statistics, esp. errors

- Negations in filter language, e.g. from ! 10.0.0.0/8

- Improve log handling

- Instead of reading/writing flow logs, store.c functions should format them
 to memory buffers (e.g. so they can be sent over the network)

- manpages
