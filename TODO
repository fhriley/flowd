* indicates things to do before 1.0 release

- Improve Filters 
- packets, octets (need predicates)
- tcpflags, src/dst AF 
- Port predicates, e.g. "port 1024-65536", "port > 1024"

- Improve log handling
 - E.g. multiple log files, based on tag?
 - support relaying of pre/post-filter packets to another agent
   - UDP
   - Unix domain socket (more important)

- Improve Perl and Python documentation				*
- Add Perl and Python regress tests				*
- Add writing of binary flows to perl and python modules	*

- Option to check TTL of inbound flow export packets
- Option to bind by interface name 
- IPv4 Multicast group join by interface. e.g. 
	join group 224.22.33.44 on fxp0

- Tools collection:
  - "flow-send", a small program to take on-disk flows and send them as 
    NetFlow packets to a chosen host
  - (or, patch flow-tools)

- More protocols: sflow, IPFIX

- Add calculation and storage of "normalised" flow timers, correcting for 
  flow probe clock errors by using difference between header->time_sec and 
  localtime (assumes flow collector clock is accurate!)

- Track sequence per peer and alert on flow drops

- Define net store.h types for:
  - min/max_pkt_lngth
  - source_id (important!)

- src/dst AS should be increased in size to 4 bytes

- Discard protocol-specific state when we receive a packet in a different
  protocol

- Don't record any nf9 flows unless the entire packet is valid (right now,
  we only validate to the flowset level)
  - Could at least iterate over packet and check for truncation?
