- Per-peer statistics, esp. errors
  - Does this make sense?

- Port predicates, e.g. "port 1024-65536"

- Improve log handling
 - E.g. multiple log files, based on tag?
 - support relaying of pre/post-filter packets to another agent (via UDP)

- Instead of reading/writing flow logs, store.c functions should format them
 to memory buffers (e.g. so they can be sent over the network)

- Add python docs and help

- Write "flow-filter", a small program to filter and/or re-tag on-disk flows 
  (reuse or share parse.y filtering code)

- Write "flow-send", a small program to take on-disk flows and send them as 
  NetFlow packets to a chosen host
