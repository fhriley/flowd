flowd is tested on OpenBSD, Linux and Solaris. It may work on other platforms, 
but may need some adjusting. Please read PLATFORMS for comments specific to 
your environment.

To build flowd, you will need Berkeley yacc. Right now, GNU bison's doesn't 
work for flowd (patches welcome). Berkeley yacc is installed by default on 
BSD based systems and is available on most Linux systems in a package called 
"byacc".

To build flowd, follow the familiar incantation:

./configure [options]
make
make install

The Perl interface no longer requires extra modules. Build it after you have
built flowd, using these commands:

cd Flowd
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

The Python module doesn't have any special dependencies beyond Python-2.3
or a newer version. To install it, run the following commands after you
have built flowd:

python setup.py build 
python setup.py install


Please report any problems to me.
