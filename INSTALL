flowd is tested on OpenBSD and Linux (Debian and Fedora Core 2). It may work
on other platforms, but may need some adjusting. 

To build flowd, you will need Berkeley yacc. Right now, GNU bison's doesn't 
work for flowd (patches welcome). Berkeley yacc is installed by default on 
BSD based systems and is available on most Linux systems in a package called 
"byacc".

To build flowd, follow the familiar incantation:

./configure [options]
make
make install

If you want to use the perl interface to the binary flow logs, then you will 
need the Socket6 module, which is available from CPAN: 

http://search.cpan.org/~umemoto/Socket6-0.17/Socket6.pm

The Python module doesn't have any special dependencies.

Please report any problems to me.
